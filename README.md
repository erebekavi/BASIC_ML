 Machine Learning 

This repo showcases my work for the Machine Learning . I completed the following tasks:

    Movie Genre Classification: Built a model to predict movie genres using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes.
    Spam SMS Detection: Developed a model to classify SMS messages as spam or legit.
    Credit Card Fraud Detection: Created a fraud detection model using Logistic Regression.

I learned how to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate them. This helped me grow my machine learning skills!
How to Run:

    Clone the repo.
    Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
    Run the scripts for each task.
