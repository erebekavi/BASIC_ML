PROBLEM STATEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------
MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines.

"""
#Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes is great for classifying text or documents based on word counts.
#TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) shows how important a word is in a document compared to others.
